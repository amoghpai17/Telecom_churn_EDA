#Problem Statement-

Orange S.A., formerly France Telecom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

#Project Summary -

The telecom industry is highly competitive, and customer retention is critical for business success. In this project, we analyzed customer data to identify factors influencing customer churn and provide recommendations to the client to improve customer retention.

We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the customer data and identified several insights. We found that the company is facing a churn rate of 14.49%, which is relatively high and needs to be addressed. Customers without any plan are more likely to churn than those with a plan, and international plan subscribers are more likely to churn than voice mail plan customers. Additionally, customers who made more than 4 calls to customer service are more likely to churn. We also found that the telecom service in the state of WY is most enjoyed by customers, while Fl, AZ, and NH need attention to improve their customer retention.

Based on these insights, we provided recommendations to the client to improve customer retention. We recommended that the company should focus on improving customer service, offer competitive pricing and plans, and offer more affordable international calling plans. Additionally, the company should focus on improving their services and plans in states with low retention rates and monitor the account length of their customers.

Overall, by implementing these recommendations, the company can improve its customer retention rate and achieve its business objectives.
